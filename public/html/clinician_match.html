                What is HLA matching?
                When two people share the same HumanLeukocyte Antigens (abbreviated as HLA), they are said to be a "match", that is, their tissues are immunologically compatible with each other. HLA are proteins that are located on the surface of the white blood cells and other tissues in the body.
                There are three general groups of HLA, they are HLA-A,HLA-B and HLA-DR. There are many different specific HLA proteins within each of these three groups. (For example, there are 59 different HLA-A proteins, 118 different HLA-B and 124 different HLA-DR!) Each of these HLA has a different numerical designation, for example, you may have HLA-A1, while some one else might have HLA-A2.
                It is important to know that HLA is inherited as a "set" of the three HLA groups, A, B, DR. This set is known as a "haplotype". Below you will notice the father has 2 distinct HLA haplotypes.
             
           
                    What is the crossmatch?

                    The crossmatch is a test which determines if the recipient hasantibody to the potential donor. Antibody is a protein, present in the serum, which could injure the donor's cells by attacking the HLA. The antibody will only injure the donor's cells if it is specific for the donor's particularHLA Not everyone has antibody againstHLA.
                    The crossmatch is performed by mixing a very small amount of the patient'sserum with a very small amount of the potential donor's white cells. If the patient has antibody to the donor's HLA, the donor's cells will be injured and this is referred to as a "positive crossmatch". A positive crossmatch is a strong indication against transplant, since it signifies that the patient has the ability to attack the donor's cells, and would, most likely attack the donor's implanted kidney.
