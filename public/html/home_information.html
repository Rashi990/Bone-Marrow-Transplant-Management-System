        <h1>What is Boan Marrow Transplant Treatment?</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="para1">
            Bone marrow transplants are lifesaving treatments for people with diseases such as leukemia, lymphoma, other cancers, or sickle cell anemia. When a person is diagnosed with such a disease and there isnâ€™t any effect from any other treatment, a stem cell transplant is carried out. A bone marrow transplant is also called a stem cell transplant. Therefore, this bone marrow transplant treatment may be the only hope for someone to live.
A bone marrow transplant is a procedure in which stem cells are removed from a patient's body and transplanted after the damaged or diseased cells have been removed. But the problem is that this type of treatment can not treat every patient.
Another type of bone marrow transplant is infusing healthy blood-forming stem cells into a patient's body to replace bone marrow that's not producing enough healthy blood cells.

        <div class="para2">
            To do this procedure, the patient's doctor has to find a bone marrow donor who matches the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type of the patient. HLA is a protein found on most cells in our bodies. Usually, doctors will first look for a matching donor in the patient's family. But the problem is that 70% of patients who need a transplant don't have a fully matched donor in their family. So they have to find a donor from outside the family.
